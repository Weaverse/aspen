# Hydrogen Cookbooks

Concrete, step-by-step guides for building specific features in a Shopify Hydrogen storefront. Each cookbook is a self-contained recipe with code, file changes, and implementation notes.

## Live Documentation

For the latest Hydrogen cookbook recipes from Shopify:

```bash
node scripts/search_shopify_docs.mjs "hydrogen cookbook <topic>"
```

For Weaverse-specific patterns:

```bash
