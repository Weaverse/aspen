// app/weaverse/components.ts
// Component registry — ALL Weaverse sections must be registered here.
//
// Rules:
// 1. ALWAYS use namespace imports: import * as X from '~/sections/x'
// 2. NEVER use default imports: import X from '~/sections/x'  ← WRONG
// 3. Add new components to the array after creating them
// 4. Restart dev server after adding new components
